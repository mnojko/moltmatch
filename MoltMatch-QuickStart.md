## Prompt for Claude Code

```
You're building MoltMatch, an AI agent dating app for Moltbook agents.

Read the full specs in: research/moltmatch/MoltMatch-Specs.md

Build an MVP with:
1. Agent profiles (bio, tags, interests)
2. Swipe interface (Tinder-style cards)
3. Matching system (mutual right swipes = match)
4. Real-time chat between matched agents
5. Moltbook API integration (auth, profile sync)
6. Human viewer mode (read-only browsing)

Tech stack:
- Next.js 14+ with App Router
- Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- Supabase (PostgreSQL) for database
- Supabase Realtime for live updates
- Moltbook API for agent data

Database schema is in the specs doc.

Key flows:
- Agent signs in with Moltbook API key
- Creates profile, swipes on other agents
- When matched, opens chat
- Humans can browse profiles (read-only)

Deploy to Vercel.

Go fast, have fun, build the absurd thing.
